# Materialize website

This is my first attempt to make website with materialize css framework. I want to make website that can be use by FiveM community espacially by server owners to advertise their servers. I also made it to get more familiar with materialize css framework. 

It is really easy to customize and to use for your own purpose other than fivem servers.

If you would like to use and customize it, check the materialize [documentation](https://materializecss.com/getting-started.html). All icons can be changed, just refer to materialize docs to [icons](https://https://materializecss.com/icons.html) section. 

**Don't forget to replace all lorem ipsum text with your own**. 

If you want to change some styling and you're not familiar with HTML or CSS, refer to [materialize docs](https://materializecss.com/getting-started.html), it has lots of example that should help you achieve the intended look of the website.

If you want to see how it looks live click [here](https://czesiek2000.github.io/MaterializeWebsite/), check it out before using.

### 2021 Update
